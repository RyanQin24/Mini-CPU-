# Description

This is a ongoing project as of May 4, 2025. This project helps me learn CPU and Computer architecture by designing simple CPU using first principle.

Instead of seeing prebuilt components like ALU and MUX, their currently all built from first principle using the 7 fundamental logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR).

By the end of Term 1B (Sep 2025), CPU should have ability to fetch and run instructions.

Currently it is a ALU with ability to Add, Subtract, AND, and compute less than operator.

Please find the simulation on circuit verse.
